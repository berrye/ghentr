# ghentr

The goal of ghentr is to make it easier for you to build custom functions to access your instance of GitHub Enterprise.

You are likely already using the functions `devtools::install_github()` and `usethis::use_github()` to interact with `github.com`. If you have an instance GitHub Enterprise (GHE), these functions have a `host` argument that lets you work with your GHE.

Let's say that you work for [Acme Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_Corporation), and that Acme has its own instance of GitHub Enterprise. At present, you could install package using the `host` argument with `devtools::install_github`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("user/repo", host = "github.acme-corp.com/api/v3")
```

In the fullness of time it may become tiresome to add the host argument. Instead, it might be handy to wrap this in a function, then put that function into a package that you can make available to your colleagues. This is what **ghentr** helps you to do. 

Let's say you create a package called **acmetools**. Using tempating functions in this package, you can add a function to your package to do the same thing:

```{r eval=FALSE}
acmetools::install_github_acme("user/repo")
```

## Installation

You can install ghentr from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ijlyttle/ghentr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r eval=FALSE}
## basic example code
