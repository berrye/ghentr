Description: The devtools package provides a couple of useful functions for 
 for working with GitHub: install_github(), to install packages from GitHub, 
 and use_github(), to connect a local package repository with GitHub. However,
 these functions are not as convenient to use with a particular instance of 
 GitHub Enterprise. You can use this package to create analagous functions in
 a custom package to work with your instance of GitHub Enterprise.
